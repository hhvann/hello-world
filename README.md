Hello, my name is Harriss and I enjoy playing disc golf in my free time. I have played over 60 different disc golf courses over the last 3 years. I can throw a frisbee over 475 feet and have achieved an amateur PDGA rating of 950. My biggest achievement so far is winning a PDGA c-tier tournament at my home course in Kernersville, NC.
